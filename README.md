# User-Research-Script

This is an obfuscated script that I have anyone performing data-cleaning use. It is a x10 multiplier for time improvement (less operational-expenditure) for less-technical peers to use, while giving them the tools to research their impacted data. 

Disclaimer: I did not create, but only made minor modifications to, this SQL. I am posting it here only because it still stands as the best and most effective representation I personally use and distribute among the data specialists I train, which I hope at the least speaks to my knowledge around the power of some bare-bones DDL and DML.
